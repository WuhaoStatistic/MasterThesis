Improving brain tumor segmentation using synthetic images from diffusion models 

The diffusion model refers to [Improved Diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion). There is minor change about data loading, we switch the normal images into npz files as sometimes we have 2 or 4 channel as input images.

The U-net is based on [This repo](https://github.com/LeeJunHyun/Image_Segmentation)

This work contributes to [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07644) (Appreciation to my supervisor and his post doc)
